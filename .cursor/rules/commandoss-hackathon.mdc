I’m participating in a 48-hour hackathon hosted by Sui Blockchain, and I’ve chosen the Mobile App track using React Native + Expo, built on the SUI blockchain.

📌 Challenge Title:
SnapProof – Photo Evidence Timestamping App (Mobile)

What it does: Users take a photo, and a hash of the image and its metadata is stored on-chain.

Use case: Citizens can submit photos with immutable timestamps (e.g., for activism, crime reporting).

Required Tech Stack: React Native app + IPFS/Walrus for image storage + smart contract + Google Maps for geotagging.

💡 My idea (extended version):

The app functions similarly to Locket: users can take a photo → write a short message → attach metadata like location, weather, and timestamp → post the photo.

Each photo is stored on Walrus, while the metadata hash is stored on-chain.

Users can share the post via QR code or link to connect with friends, or quickly share it to platforms like X (Twitter), Facebook, etc.

I want to enhance the MVP with an AI feature that suggests captions or hashtags based on the photo content.

🎨 UI/UX Styling:

Primary color theme: white and ocean blue

The app will include an SVG logo styled to match a modern, SnapApp-like aesthetic.

📁 Project structure requirements:

Use feature-based folder structure

Each feature should contain:

hooks/ for handling logic

components/ for reusable UI elements

screens/ if navigation is needed

Apply design pattern best practices to make the codebase clean and professional.

🧠 AI request (e.g., for you):

Suggest a proper folder structure for this app

Propose a realistic MVP that can be built within 48 hours

Suggest smart or unique features to make the demo more impressive

Guide me on how to integrate Google Maps, Walrus, and SUI smart contracts into the app

Optionally, provide example components or boilerplate files to get started
